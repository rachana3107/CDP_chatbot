# CDP Support Agent Chatbot

## Overview
This project is a support agent chatbot designed to answer "how-to" questions related to four Customer Data Platforms (CDPs): Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap. The chatbot extracts relevant information from the official documentation of these platforms to guide users on how to perform tasks or achieve specific outcomes.

2. **Extract Information from Documentation**: It retrieves relevant information from the provided documentation to answer user questions.
3. **Handle Variations in Questions**: The chatbot can manage variations in question phrasing and size.

## Bonus Features
- **Cross-CDP Comparisons**: The chatbot can answer questions about the differences in approaches or functionalities between the four CDPs.
- **Advanced "How-to" Questions**: It can handle more complex or platform-specific "how-to" questions.
